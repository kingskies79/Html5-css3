        <p>So, I went back and read the instructions
                myself to see what I'd done wrong. They
                said:</p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>Remove the tray from the box. Pierce
                 the overwrap several times with a
                fork and cook on High for <mark>15
                 minutes</mark>, rotating it half way
                 through.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I thought he'd told me <em>fifty</em>. No
                 wonder it exploded in my microwave.</p>
