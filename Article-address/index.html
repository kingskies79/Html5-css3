        <h1>Antoni Gaudi</h1>
        <p>Many tourists are drawn to  Barcelona to see Antoni Gaudí's   incredible architecture.</p>
        <p>Barcelona celebrated the 150th anniversary of Gaudí's birth in 2002.</p>
        <h2>La Casa Milà</h2>
        <p>Gaudí's work was essentially useful.
            <span lang="es">La Casa Milà</span> is
            an apartment building and real people
            live there.</p>
            <h2>La Sagrada Família</h2>
 <p>The complicatedly named and curiously
 unfinished Expiatory Temple of the
 Sacred Family is the most visited
 building in Barcelona.</p>
